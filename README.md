# User Profiling and Segmentation for Ads

## Overview

This project aims to perform user profiling and segmentation based on online behavior and ad interaction metrics. The goal is to identify user clusters or segments that can be targeted for specific ad campaigns. We will use demographic and statistical analysis techniques to gain insights into user behavior and preferences.

## Frameworks
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

## Steps Overview

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze demographic data (age, gender, income level).
   - Perform statistical analysis on user behavior metrics (time spent online, likes, click-through rates).

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Use insights from EDA to select relevant features for clustering.
   - Transform and preprocess data for clustering algorithms.

3. **User Profiling and Segmentation:**
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans) to profile users into distinct segments.
   - Analyze and interpret user clusters based on online behavior and ad interaction metrics.
